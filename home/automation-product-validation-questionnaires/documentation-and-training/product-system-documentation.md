# Product/System Documentation

**Query 1:** Declaration / Certification of compliance to standards & codes etc. What timeline are you on, and for bespoke solutions are you able to provide a certificate of conformity?

**Response:** The majority of critical components are CE certified. Each customer's deployment is a bespoke configuration and design and as such cannot be certified in a standard manner. We currently plan to seek both CE and IN standards compliance for our major modules and components of our products that are commonly deployed.

All the items with CE certification data attached:
