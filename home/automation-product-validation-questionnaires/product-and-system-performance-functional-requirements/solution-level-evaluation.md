# Solution Level Evaluation

**Query 1**: Provide a high-level description of the solution, its functions, features, applications, and limitations.&#x20;

**Response**: Robotic systems enhance storage efficiency and expedite the process of item picking. This drives substantial cost savings and ensures error-free operations in item storage, order picking, packing, and dispatch across a diverse range of use cases, industries, and warehouse sizes.

**Query 2**: Design guidelines for product(s) and system(s) listed. Also provide the product specification design guides, etc.

**Response**: 600m x 400mm x 240mm maximums. \
Product specification for cube 2.6 Mtr (W) x 2 Mtr (L) x 2.5 Mtr (H).

**Query 3**: Describe the products or systems on the list and/or give examples of common solutions. Give examples of case studies.

**Response**: components for quick commerce in the ePharma sector, secure high-value storage systems, and MRO use cases. components for MRO use cases, as well as safe storage for valuable items such as laptops, cell phones, electronics, gold, ePharma, etc.

**Query 4**: Explain how throughputs are calculated for the solution proposed. Include a list of all inputs, assumptions, constraints, and conditions applied.

**Response**: The number of throughputs per bin depends on item dimension and tray dimension 600 (L) x 400 (W) x bin height.

**Query 5**: Explain how throughputs are simulated for the solution proposed. Include a list of all inputs, assumptions, constraints, and conditions applied. What is the digital twin? What are the activity details, e.g., order details, that are required for the simulation?

**Response**: Throughputs are simulated via Digital Twin Simulator. The digital twin allows automated benchmarking scripts to be run, which output all the statistics.

**Query 6**: Provide % redundancy in the solution per subsystem. Elaborate and describe equipment and IT related redundancy aspects.

**Response**: 60%+ The entire system is well instrumented for real time monitoring and designed for fast swap of components, allowing for a value-engineered system.

**Query 7**: Do you offer a fleet/material flow management system as part of the solution? Please provide a brief description of functionality.

**Response**: Not Applicable.

**Query 8**: Use of standard tools when developing/designing products and solutions (e.g., AutoCAD, Inventor, Navisworks, ePlan, demo3D, etc.).&#x20;

**Response**: Inventor Professional, Q Electro,Python,Blender

**Query 9**: What safety considerations are applied when designing a solution?

**Response**: Safety and ISO standards are mentioned in the other sections.

**Query 10**: Define the solution design process. What details do you need to initiate a solution design? do you have a checklist or questionnaire? Do you always do a prototype for each solution?

**Response**: Requirements gathering -> brainstorming -> initial specification -> review meetings -> prototype development -> testing -> productize it post acceptance.

**Query 12**: How do you ensure alignment between the concept and the capabilities/functionality of the control/SCADA systems?

**Response**: To ensure alignment between the system concept and the capabilities of the control systems, we begin by reviewing vendor documentation, product descriptions, and specifications available on official websites. This includes details on system architecture, supported protocols, data logging, alarm handling, integration with PLCs, and user access control. We also refer to earlier project documentation to confirm that the conceptual design aligns with technical requirements and end-user expectations.

A functionality matrix is developed to map each system requirement to a corresponding SCADA feature, allowing us to identify and address any gaps. Where necessary, custom configurations or additional modules are proposed in collaboration with the vendor. This process ensures that the implemented system fully supports the intended functionality and operational goals.

**Query 13**: How do you ensure that the product(s), system(s), and solutions meet all requirements of the project, site, and local country?

**Response**: We design the robot/system considering all the inputs/requirements given by the customer. We can provide a process flow diagram to our vendors to carry out the manufacturing process.

**Query 14**: How do you manage continuous improvement/change requests? Any roadmap you follow?

**Response**: Agile, responsive, feet-on-the-ground approach. We leverage Git for our repositories and for archiving and rollbacks when necessary.

**Query 15**: What is your approach to backward compatibility/mixed versions of product(s) and system(s) within the same solution?&#x20;

**Response**: Ensure no breaking backwards compatibility issues for at least 12 months post-release.
