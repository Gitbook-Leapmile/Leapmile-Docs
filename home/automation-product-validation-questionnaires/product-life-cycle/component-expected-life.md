# Component Expected Life

**Query 1**: Warranty of individual components, if different from products/system.

**Response**: Warranty terms for individual components may differ from the overall product or system warranty, depending on the manufacturer and nature of the component. Typically, components sourced from third-party OEMs carry their own manufacturer warranties, which may vary in duration and coverage (e.g., 12, 24, or 36 months). These are passed through to the client as-is.

In contrast, the system-level warranty covers the integrated performance and functionality of the complete solution as delivered. This includes installation quality, configuration, and system behavior under normal operating conditions. Any differences in warranty terms between components and the overall system will be clearly outlined in the contract documentation.

**Query 2**: Lifetime of critical component(s) (in number of operational hours).

**Response**: The operational lifetime of critical components in control systems typically ranges from 30,000 to 100,000 hours, depending on the type of component and operating conditions. For example, PLC modules and I/O cards often last between 50,000 and 100,000 hours, while servers, HMI panels, and power supplies usually have lifespans around 30,000 to 60,000 hours. Components like UPS batteries and cooling fans generally have shorter lifetimes due to wear and environmental factors. Actual lifetimes depend on usage, maintenance, and manufacturer specifications, so consulting datasheets for specific parts is recommended.

**Query 3**: What testing/validation was conducted to derive these values?

**Response**: Each release of our product undergoes comprehensive internal testing to ensure its reliability and performance. While the detailed reports generated from these tests are confidential, we prioritize transparency with our customers. Should any known issues or operational risks be identified during the testing phase, we will promptly publish these to operators along with any remedial steps. This proactive communication reflects our commitment to delivering a high-quality product and ensuring your operational safety.

**Query 4**: How do you ensure the long-term availability of OEM parts?

**Response**: We ensure the long-term availability of OEM parts through proactive supplier management and strategic inventory planning. This includes maintaining strong relationships with OEMs to stay informed about product life cycles, anticipated obsolescence, and new part releases. We also monitor market trends and lead times to anticipate supply risks.

Additionally, where possible, we establish agreements with OEMs or authorized distributors to secure priority access to critical components and maintain a stock of essential spare parts. When parts are approaching end-of-life, we work with OEMs to identify suitable alternatives or upgrade paths, ensuring continuity of support and minimizing downtime over the systemâ€™s operational life.
