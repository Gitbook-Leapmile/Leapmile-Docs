# Product/Component Refurbishment or Replacement Availability Long Term

**Query 1**: Once a product(s) reaches its nominal "end of life", what is the process? (i.e., refurbishment?)? Replacement? retrofit new version of product?)

**Response**: Once a product reaches its nominal ""end of life,"" we have a systematic approach in place to ensure its continued performance and reliability. Our policy involves conducting regular inspections to assess the condition of the product. During these inspections, any parts that show signs of wear and tear are replaced as needed to extend the product's lifespan.

If a product is deemed beyond refurbishment, we offer options for replacement or retrofitting with a newer version of the product. This ensures that you can maintain operational efficiency while benefiting from the latest advancements in technology. We are committed to supporting you throughout the entire lifecycle of our products, ensuring they meet your needs effectively.

**Query 2**: How long will product(s)/components be available for after the go-live of the system?

**Response:** The Target is 5 years, subject to the system being under AMC throughout that period.

**Query 3**: What is the development and obsolescence roadmap for the product(s) and system(s) listed?

**Response**: Our development and obsolescence roadmap is designed to ensure that our products and systems remain current and effective while providing clear guidance for our customers. We continuously invest in research and development to enhance existing products and introduce new features based on market needs and technological advancements.

As for obsolescence, we follow a proactive approach. Before any product is phased out, we provide ample notice and support, including options for upgrades or replacements. This process includes regular communication about upcoming changes and a detailed timeline to facilitate smooth transitions.

**Query 4**: If the product(s) and system(s) listed are replaced, can they or parts thereof be recycled?

**Response**: Yes, our products and systems are designed with sustainability in mind, and we encourage recycling whenever possible. Many components can be recycled, reducing environmental impact and promoting responsible disposal. We provide guidance on the proper recycling procedures for different parts, ensuring that they are handled in an environmentally friendly manner.

**Query 5**: Does the product have the ability, and/or is it economical, to do component refurbishment, or does it require replacement after declared product asset life?

**Response**: The ability to refurbish components depends on several factors, including the specific part in question, the vendor, and the refurbishment capabilities available at the deployment location. While many components can be refurbished economically, some may require replacement once they reach the end of their asset life.

We recommend evaluating each component individually, as the decision to refurbish or replace will vary based on its condition and the resources available.
