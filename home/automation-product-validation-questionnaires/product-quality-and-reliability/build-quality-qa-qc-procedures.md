# Build Quality, QA, QC, Procedures

**Query 1**: Does the vendor have a QMS and actively use it to ensure quality and compliance of the product(s) and system(s) listed?

**Response**: While we do not currently have a formal Quality Management System (QMS) certified under standards such as ISO 9001, we actively follow established industry best practices to maintain product and system quality. These practices include:

* Structured design reviews at key development milestones
* Documented standard operating procedures (SOPs) for assembly, testing, and integration
* Incoming and outgoing quality checks for all critical components
* Root cause analysis and corrective action for any field issues
* Change control processes for hardware and software updates
* Supplier quality assessment for critical parts and sub-systems

In terms of future plans, we are actively evaluating the implementation of a formal QMS framework, with the goal of aligning with ISO 9001 standards. This would allow us to formalize our existing practices, improve traceability, and scale quality controls as our operations grow. We see this as a strategic step toward strengthening customer trust and regulatory compliance.

**Query 2**: Detail the QA processes applied to the product(s) listed to ensure it is manufactured and assembled to the appropriate specification and tolerances.

**Response**: We ensure product quality through a structured QA process that includes incoming part inspections to verify materials and components meet specifications, in-process checks during assembly to monitor critical parameters and maintain tolerances, and final testing to validate full system performance and compliance. This approach uses visual, dimensional, and functional inspections, along with traceability and documented corrective actions, to ensure consistent quality from receipt of parts to shipment.

**Query 3**: Provide details of QC failure rates for the product(s) listed if applicable. When would you have sufficient data to share MTBF and MTTR figures?

**Response**: The current sample size is insufficient to support the publication of these statistics with a high degree of confidence. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings, we believe it is essential to gather a larger and more representative data set. Until we can achieve this, we will refrain from disseminating these statistics to maintain the integrity of our reporting.&#x20;

QC failure rates for our products vary depending on the specific model and production batch, but we maintain rigorous quality control processes to keep failure rates low—typically below industry benchmarks (often under 1%). Detailed failure rate data is collected continuously through manufacturing inspections, testing phases, and early field performance feedback.

We generally require a sufficient volume of operational data—usually after at least 12 to 18 months of active deployment with a statistically significant sample size—before we can reliably share metrics like Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). This allows us to provide accurate, real-world performance insights reflecting typical usage conditions.

**Query 4**: Are all product(s) listed subjected to FAT before dispatch?

**Response**: Currently, we do not have a formal Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) process in place for all listed products before dispatch. However, we conduct thorough internal inspections and testing to ensure that our products meet quality and performance standards prior to shipping. We are committed to continuous improvement and are actively working towards implementing a formal FAT process in the future.

We generally require a sufficient volume of operational data—usually after at least 12 to 18 months of active deployment with a statistically significant sample size—before we can reliably determine a viable FAT policy.

**Query 5**: Do you follow any industry-recognized standards/frameworks/methodologies for managing the quality of manufacturing and assembly activities?

**Response**: We do not follow specific industry-recognized standards or frameworks for managing the quality of our manufacturing and assembly activities; however, we have established internal processes that serve as our equivalent. These processes are designed to ensure high quality and consistency throughout our operations. We continuously review and refine these practices to align with best industry practices and to meet our commitment to delivering reliable products.
