# Reliability (MTTF, MTBF = Downtime and Uptime)

**Query 1**: What is the MTTF and MTBF (downtime & uptime) of the product(s) listed? When would you have sufficient data to share MTBF and MTTR figures?

**Response**: The current sample size is insufficient to support the publication of these statistics with a high degree of confidence. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings, we believe it is essential to gather a larger and more representative data set. Until we can achieve this, we will refrain from disseminating these statistics to maintain the integrity of our reporting.

QC failure rates for our products vary depending on the specific model and production batch, but we maintain rigorous quality control processes to keep failure rates low—typically below industry benchmarks (often under 1%). Detailed failure rate data is collected continuously through manufacturing inspections, testing phases, and early field performance feedback.

We generally require a sufficient volume of operational data—usually after at least 12 to 18 months of active deployment with a statistically significant sample size—before we can reliably share metrics like Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). This allows us to provide accurate, real-world performance insights reflecting typical usage conditions.

**Query 2**: How do you measure, report, and underwrite the availability of the system?

**Response**: We have implemented a comprehensive dashboard and logging system, along with integrated alerting mechanisms across all our software platforms. This setup allows for real-time monitoring of system performance and user activity, providing valuable insights into operational efficiency. The alerting system ensures that any anomalies or issues are promptly detected and communicated, enabling swift responses to maintain optimal functionality. This proactive approach reflects our commitment to delivering reliable software solutions and enhancing user experience.
