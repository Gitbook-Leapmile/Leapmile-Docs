# Ergonomics of Picking/Put Away

**Query 1**: Describe the typical interaction between operators and the product(s) and/or system(s) listed. Include depositing and collecting items.&#x20;

**Response**: The typical interaction between operators and our product(s) and/or system(s) involves several key activities designed to ensure efficient and safe operation.

1. **Initial Setup and Calibration**\
   Operators begin by setting up and calibrating the system according to specific operational requirements. This involves selecting appropriate settings, loading configurations, and conducting preliminary tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
2. **Monitoring and Control**\
   Once the system is operational, operators monitor real-time data through user-friendly interfaces that display key performance indicators and system status. Operators can adjust parameters as needed to optimize performance, responding to any alerts or notifications generated by the system.
3. **Interaction with Safety Features**\
   Operators interact with various safety features, such as emergency stop buttons and safety interlocks. They are trained to use these features effectively to ensure safety during normal operation and in emergency situations.
4. **Maintenance and Troubleshooting**\
   Regular maintenance is part of the interaction process. Operators perform routine checks, follow maintenance protocols, and may troubleshoot minor issues. If complex problems arise, they may need to consult with maintenance personnel or refer to the systemâ€™s diagnostic tools for further assistance.
5. **Training and Feedback**\
   Operators participate in ongoing training to stay updated on best practices and any system enhancements. They also provide feedback based on their experiences, which is crucial for continuous improvement of both the product and operational procedures.
6. **User Documentation**\
   Operators utilize user manuals and documentation to assist them in their tasks. This includes guidelines for setup, operation, troubleshooting, and safety measures, ensuring they have the necessary resources to interact effectively with the system.

Conclusion\
Overall, the interaction between operators and our products is designed to be intuitive, safe, and efficient, with a focus on empowering operators through training, clear interfaces, and robust support mechanisms.

**Login** **Process:**

* Scan the QR code for authentication using the scanner.
* Choose either Inbound or Pickup (Outbound).\
  Inbound Process:

**Inbound Proces**s:

* Select the required bin and confirm.
* Once the bin is retrieved, scan the Part ID and place the item into the bin. If there are multiple items with the same Part ID, scan each one separately.
* Tap Complete Order.
* To process another order, tap Continue, or select Logout to exit.\
  Outbound Goods Process:

**Outbound Process**:

* Select and confirm the bin from the pick list.
* Once the bin is retrieved, pick the product and scan the part number. If multiple items have the same part number, scan each separately.
* Tap Complete Order.
* To process another order, tap Continue, or select Logout to exit.

**Query 2**: Explain the ergonomic factors that should be taken into account when maintenance staff interact with the listed product or systems.&#x20;

**Response**: The process for the inbound handling of goods and the subsequent picking of items has been thoughtfully designed to ensure simplicity and ease of execution. All activities are strategically positioned within easy reach on a level floor, allowing for efficient workflows and minimizing physical strain. This user-friendly approach enhances operational efficiency and ensures that employees can perform their tasks with comfort and convenience.&#x20;

**Query 3**: Describe the ergonomic features and considerations of the product(s) listed and the system as a whole. Also provide heights of operator interfaces such as deposit and collect positions plus operator panels/pushbuttons.&#x20;

**Response**: Picking stations have been strategically established in user-friendly locations to optimize accessibility and workflow. To promote safety and prevent strain, the system enforces a weight limit of 20 kilograms for all items, ensuring that no excessively heavy loads are allowed. Additionally, clear and intuitive labeling is consistently provided throughout the system, enabling users to easily orient themselves and locate items swiftly. This thoughtful design enhances operational efficiency and supports a safe, organized working environment.&#x20;

Console interface - 1m from ground

* Tab and Scanneer - 1.1m to 1.2m from ground
* Emergency Button - 1.6m to 1.7m from ground
* Operator Interface - 1.5m

(Height Adjustment is possible as per user requirement.)
