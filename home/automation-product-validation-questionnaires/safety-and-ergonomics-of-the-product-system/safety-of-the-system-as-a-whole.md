# Safety of the System as a Whole

**Query 1**: Confirm if system(s) listed are CE certified. If so, please provide certificates.

**Response**: Our product incorporates an advanced IR-based obstacle avoidance methodology designed to enhance safety and efficiency during operation. This functionality enables the system to detect and respond to obstacles in its environment, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted performance. The IR-based system utilizes infrared sensors to continuously scan for potential obstacles, and when an obstacle is detected, the system analyzes and initiates the appropriate response.

**Query 2**: Specify for the subsystem(s) listed all applicable Indian standards and codes and the level of compliance to them. In general, compliance with local standards shall prevail over international standards.

**Response:** We have designed our products to ensure ease of compliance with core industry standards and similar criteria. We will prioritize compliance with local Indian standards to ensure safety and quality. Our team strives to monitor changes in standards and to proactively maintain and improve compliance levels. Note that the product currently is not yet certified under these target standards.

**Query 3**: Has safety in design been considered for the lifecycle of the system and each subsystem? Lifecycle: Installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning (for NSW, refer to Section 22 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011).

**Response**: Real-Time Detection: The infrared sensors provide real-time monitoring, enabling immediate detection of obstacles, whether they are static or moving.

**Query 4**: Confirm the noise level of the system as a whole is less than the legislated limits.

**Response**: We believe the noise level of our product is below the legislated limits. The average noise level is 60 dB.\
For additional noise mitigation, we recommend the following measures:

* Ensuring proper installation and maintenance to minimize vibration and noise transmission.
* Utilizing sound-absorbing materials in the surrounding environment.

**Query 5**: Give an overview of the hardware safety system's features and overall methodology, including mechanical guarding, safety devices, and access/egress requirements. Provide more details so that we can comprehend the safety features and infrastructure that protect operators and maintenance/recovery

**Response**: The system can safely function through any dynamic changes in environments because it is built to halt operations to prevent collisions.\
Mechanical guarding:\
See 1.1.6 for additional safety features.

**Query 6**: Provide the risk assessments for the system as a whole in accordance with AS 4024 (ISO 12100), clearly identifying the residual risks posed by the system. Please provide a current risk assessment.

**Response**: We have designed our products to ensure ease of compliance with core industry standards and similar criteria. We will prioritize compliance with local Indian standards to ensure safety and quality. Our team strives to monitor changes in standards and to proactively maintain and improve compliance levels. Note that the product currently is not yet certified under these target standards.

With regard to risk assessments for our system in accordance with AS 4024 (ISO 12100), we have not yet formally sought certification under the ISO 12100 standard. We have conducted a risk assessment that evaluates both the system as a whole and the interactions between various products and subsystems, as well as their interaction with operators and maintenance personnel.

Overview of the Risk Assessment:

* **Identification of Hazards**: Systematically identified potential hazards associated with each component of the system, including mechanical, electrical, and operational risks.
* **Risk Analysis:** Each identified hazard was analyzed to determine the likelihood of occurrence and the potential severity of its impact. This analysis involved both qualitative and quantitative assessments.
* **Risk Evaluation**: Assessed the identified risks against predetermined acceptance criteria, categorizing them into acceptable and unacceptable risks.
* **Residual Risks**: Despite implementing various safety measures, certain residual risks remain. These include:
* **Mechanical Risks**: Potential for moving parts to cause injury if access is not properly restricted during operation. Mitigation measures include interlocks and safety guarding, but there remains a residual risk when maintenance is performed.
* Electrical Risks: While our systems include protective devices, there is a residual risk of electrical shock during maintenance if proper procedures are not followed.
* **Operational Risks:** The interaction between operators and the system could lead to errors in operation, particularly in complex tasks. Continuous training and clear operational procedures help mitigate this risk, but some residual risk remains during high-pressure situations.
* **Operator Interaction**: Operators must be provided with comprehensive training and clear instructions, and the system features user-friendly interfaces. However, human error cannot be entirely eliminated, contributing to residual risks.
* **Maintenance Personnel**: Specific procedures and safety protocols have been established for maintenance tasks to minimize risks. Despite these protocols, some residual risks are inherent due to the nature of maintenance work, particularly when troubleshooting or repairing live equipment.

**Conclusion**\
The risk assessment details the interactions among products, subsystems, and personnel, clearly outlining the identified residual risks and the strategies implemented to mitigate them. We are committed to continuous monitoring and improvement of our safety measures to minimize these risks further.
