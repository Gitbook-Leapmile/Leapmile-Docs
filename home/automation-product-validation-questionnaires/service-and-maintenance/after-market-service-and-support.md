**Response**: Tickets are systematically assigned and closely monitored to ensure timely resolution, with clear priorities set based on the issue’s severity and impact. An established escalation matrix is in place to promptly address any critical or persistent problems, ensuring that the right expertise is engaged at each level. Beyond just resolving symptoms, we emphasize thorough root cause analysis (RCA) for every significant issue. This involves detailed investigation techniques—such as fault tree analysis, data log reviews, and stakeholder interviews—to identify the underlying causes of failures or disruptions. By addressing root causes rather than just immediate fixes, we prevent recurrence, improve system reliability, and enhance overall operational performance. The insights gained from RCA are documented and fed back into continuous improvement processes, including updates to maintenance practices, software patches, or training programs. This structured approach ensures that issue management not only restores service quickly but also drives long-term resilience.
