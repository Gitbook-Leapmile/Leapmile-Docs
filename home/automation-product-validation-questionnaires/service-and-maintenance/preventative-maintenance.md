# Preventative Maintenance

**Query 1**: What service and support modules can be provided?

**Response**: We offer comprehensive service and support packages that include scheduled inspections and preventative maintenance visits (onsite or remote) as defined in the Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) and technical support for controls and IT with customizable coverage hoursâ€”including rapid on-call technician response for emergencies. Additional options include consignment spares stocked onsite or nearby, warranty extensions, and onsite support for commissioning, upgrades, and training. All service levels, response times, and coverage are tailored through the AMC to meet client needs and ensure optimal system reliability.

**Query 2**: Provide the OEM/product inspection frequency for the product(s) listed.

**Response**: Systems under AMC will have a service cadence agreed upon and followed as per AMC SLA.

**Query 3**: Provide a preventative maintenance plan specifying the frequency and processes for preventative maintenance, ad hoc repair, etc. for the product(s) listed.

**Response**: Systems under AMC will have a service cadence agreed upon and followed as per AMC SLA.

**Query 4**: Describe the methods for recovering the elements of the subsystem(s) and/or the subsystem(s) listed. Consider typical scenarios, as well as the worst case.

**Response**: Our recovery methods for the subsystems are designed to effectively handle both typical and worst-case scenarios to ensure minimal disruption and quick restoration of operations.

Typical Scenarios: Routine maintenance through regular inspections and preventive checks helps detect and resolve minor issues early. The system supports automated recovery features such as automatic restarts or recalibration to address minor operational disruptions without manual intervention. Additionally, operators have access to predefined procedures to perform user-initiated resets or component restarts for quick service restoration.

Worst-Case Scenarios: In the event of a major system failure, we provide detailed step-by-step troubleshooting guides to systematically identify and resolve the root cause. Robust backup and data recovery protocols safeguard system configurations and operational data, enabling rapid restoration after data loss. If problems persist, our technical support team is available to provide remote assistance or on-site support to ensure timely and effective recovery.

Together, these methods ensure that the subsystems maintain high availability and operational efficiency across a range of possible failure scenarios.

**Query 5**: Describe which aspects of fault/recovery/restart and maintenance activities are to be done by DHL and the vendor.

**Response**: Since each system is configured differently, we will provide relevant training to the staff and documentation at that time.

**Query 6**: Does the system track the operational hours and condition of key components? If yes, what components are monitored?

**Response**: Yes for major items such as shuttles, electronics, etc.

**Query 7**: Is there a reporting method/early warning system in place based on system diagnostics of the product(s) in use?

**Response**: Logging of these statistics is available.

**Query 8**: Does the vendor provide reports for all maintenance (planned/ad hoc) carried out? If so, please explain the method followed and provide an example report if possible. Do you use a CMMS if so based on which product?

**Response**: Every AMC service request will be documented and stored in a repository for review. No we do not use a special CMMS tool.

**Query 9**: What processes must be put in place for the maintenance to occur?

**Response**: Routine service calls are prescheduled, and all other service calls will be based on either customer-initiated tickets or proactive calls due to system telemetry.
