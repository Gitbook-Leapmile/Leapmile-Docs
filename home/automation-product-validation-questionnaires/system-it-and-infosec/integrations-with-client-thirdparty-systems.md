# Integrations with Client/ThirdParty Systems

**Query 1**: List preferred formats and protocols for integrating with ERP, WMS, WCS, etc.

**Response**: REST API calling interfaces with data transmitted both ways via JSON format. We have an integration package that allows flexible script development for external interfaces.

**Query 2**: Describe the level of complexity that your system(s) is capable of in relation to integration with other systems. Do you operate as a white/grey or black box?

**Response**: Integration is designed to be very simple to implement and easy to manage both backwards compatibility and progressive forward releases. We offer a detailed REST API for complex low-level integration if needed. However, we recommend integrations be based on black box-like assumptions and secure file import and export.

**Query 3**: List and describe reference sites, explaining the level of complexity of integration. What ERP/WMS systems have you integrated with?

**Response**: REST APIs for other WMS integrations could serve as a good proxy. Integration is designed to be simple and robust. File interchange is the recommended framework for import/export of data.

**Query 4**: Is your system capable of managing/working with other MHE systems?

**Response**: This is not necessary.

**Query 5**: Can you offer integration/messaging visibility for monitoring/reporting/troubleshooting/reprocessing purposes?

**Response**: Yes.

**Query 6**: Are the vendor’s system communication protocols as per DHL’s requirements? Give details on the communication protocols.

**Response**: SMPT email, SMS text messages, and REST API webhooks for real-time notifications.

**Query 7**: Ability to adhere to DHL interface requirements and standard API JSON format?

**Response**: Once we are fully briefed on the DHL standard, we do not anticipate any hurdles in complying.

**Query 8**: Do you have the ability to use customer infrastructure (e.g., servers (ability to work with cloud environments), Wi-Fi)?

**Response**: Yes.

**Query 9**: The middleware/WCS platform chosen by the vendor must be flexible, scalable, and robust for all future DHL needs, including increases in messaging volumes and other functionalities.

**Response**: We are committed to selecting a platform that not only supports current operational demands but also adapts to evolving requirements. Our approach will include thorough evaluations of potential vendors, focusing on their track record in scalability and flexibility, as well as their capacity to integrate new functionalities seamlessly. We will prioritize platforms that offer strong performance metrics and can easily adapt to future technological advancements, ensuring DHL remains at the forefront of innovation.
