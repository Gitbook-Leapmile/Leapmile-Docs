# Preventative Maintenance

### Quarterly Maintenance Procedure

* The below-mentioned points are for the periodic maintenance of all the robots.&#x20;
* For any retightening of fasteners, it is mandatory to apply Loctite 243
* Use a torque wrench to tighten the fasteners (if available), as per the chart given below.
* Fasteners need to be marked with yellow paint after fastening. green or Red dot indicates the number of times its tightened
* Avoid overtightening of the fasteners.

### Maintenance Checklist

* Check the drive chain's tension and oil (SAE 20 to 40) chains.
* Check up the LM guideways, guide blocks, and racks and apply grease.
* Check the tray holder and its riveting condition and apply the PTFE spray on the tray holders.
* Check the condition of the anti-friction tape applied on the Push pull; if found to be worn, replace it
* Check the Pushpull magnet head a. Fasteners b. LM Guide Blocks c. Magnet Deformation, if any, due to heat ? d. Chain and magnet head attachment bracket.
* Check the Vertical system and Horizontal system fasteners; if loose, fasten them
* Check the side bay area coupler and its condition, and fasten its grub screws.
* Fasteners that are marked critical with critical identification marks need to be checked without ignorance.
* Observe for any physical damages on cables, drag chain, controller parts, and light curt light curtains sensors and camera lens with clean solution & a new microfiber cloth.&#x20;
* Listen for excessive audible vibration and noise.
* Monitor robot in motion, inspecting robot, harness, limit switches, and cables.&#x20;
* Check for robot repeatability.
* Position deviation: The robot functions outside of its intended perimeters.
* Repeatability issues: The robot is unable to perform consistent, repetitive movements.
* Cable damage: Wear and tear on power and data-transmitting cords, wires, and cables can cause electrical fires.
* Safety issues: The robot behaves unpredictably, resulting in a risk of injury for your staff.
