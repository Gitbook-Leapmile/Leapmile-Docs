# Shuttles

Shuttles are an integral element that transport totes and trays between racks, facilitating automated decanting, storage, and retrieval. Prioritizing worker safety and efficiency, they expedite picking operations through intelligent software orchestration, intelligent routing, and efficient design. Shuttles adapted to diverse tote \&tray sizes and accommodated multiple storage depths on both sides of the rack aisle.
