# Stations

The racking design supports flexible tote locations for efficient operations like decanting, sorting, and dispatch. Secure kiosk-style stations enable authenticated pickups and drop-offs via QR or barcodes, with automatic doors and safety curtains ensuring user safety. These stations also verify item weight, size, and image after transactions. Dynamic in-rack pickup locations enhance flexibility and speed, especially during peak times, with software and indicators enabling concurrent, separate, or bulk order picking for optimized workflows.
