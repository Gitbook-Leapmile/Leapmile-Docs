# Totes

Totes employed are industry-standard and can be partitioned into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 compartments using removable dividers. This approach optimises volume utilisation, accommodates a greater number of SKUs, and reduces manual errors. Tote size and distribution can be easily adjusted by repositioning within the racks as per requirements.
