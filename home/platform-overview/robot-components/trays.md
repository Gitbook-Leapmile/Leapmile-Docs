# Trays

Tray design optimises existing infrastructure to accommodate various carton sizes and totes. The utilisation of trays expedites the automated insertion and retrieval of items from storage, including full and mixed case picking as well. By accommodating carton sizes up to 600 x 400 x 400 mm (23.5 x 15.5 x 15.5 in), this reduces the need to decant cartons.
