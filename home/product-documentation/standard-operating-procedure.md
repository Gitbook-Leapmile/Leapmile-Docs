# Standard Operating Procedure

The LeapMile NanoWarehouse robotic system is designed for efficient and autonomous material handling in compact warehouse environments. Daily operations begin with ensuring that the power supply is stable (220V single-phase, 5A socket) and connected to a UPS for backup. The operator powers on the local server and robot supervisor PC, confirms LAN connectivity (100 Mbps), and checks internet access.

During operation, users log in to the dashboard or mobile app to initiate order processing. The system supports both batch and continuous picking modes, with real-time visibility into task assignments and robot activity. Operators engage with the bay station to load or unload bins, ensuring all manual interventions adhere to safety protocols. System monitoring is done through the live dashboard, which displays robot status, bin movement, and throughput metrics. Any technical difficulties are reported via the built-in ticketing system and escalated through the predefined escalation matrix.

At the end of the day, all active tasks are completed, and robots are parked in their designated charging bays. System data is backed up to the remote/cloud server before safely shutting down supervisor applications and local machines. Routine maintenance includes daily cleaning of the bay and rack areas, weekly inspection of robot sensors and wheels, and monthly checks on power systems and UPS health. Software updates and root cause analyses (RCA) are conducted as needed to ensure ongoing reliability and performance.

#### Installation Guidelines

Proper installation of the NanoWarehouse system is critical to its performance and safety. The site must be fully prepared prior to setup. This includes having a level and clean floor surface to allow accurate movement of autonomous robots, with enough ceiling clearance (minimum 3.5 meters) to accommodate the 3-meter-high storage racks. Electrical requirements include a dedicated 220V, 5A, 3-pin socket connected to a UPS. The site must also have reliable internet access (minimum 100 Mbps) and local LAN points for internal communication.

Installation begins with assembling the modular storage racks and securely installing the bay station, ensuring ergonomic placement for operator access. The local server and supervisor PC are then set up and connected to the network. All required software—Robot Supervisor, Camera Supervisor, and the administrative mobile app—is installed and configured, and cloud/remote connectivity is tested.

Following the hardware and software setup, calibration is performed for bin positions, robot alignment, and camera-based validations. The system is tested with multiple trial pick-and-place cycles to verify performance. After successful testing, a formal handover is conducted, including The delivery includes layout plans, robot serial numbers, admin credentials, maintenance procedures, and AMC documentation.
