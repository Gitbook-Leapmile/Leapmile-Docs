### Custom Nature of Deployments

While the components used in the platform are certified to industry standards, the deployment and configuration of each system are bespoke, tailored to meet the unique requirements of each warehouse. Custom configurations and integrations, including rack sizes, shuttle layouts, and station placements, as well as software customizations (such as custom APIs, database schema modifications, or unique business logic), prevent the system from being certified as a whole.

#### Key points regarding custom deployments:

* **Hardware Configurations**: Custom rack layouts, shuttle track designs, and integration with other automation elements (e.g., conveyors, shuttles, pickers) cannot be standardized due to the unique requirements of each warehouse and operational flow.
* **Software Customization**: Custom modules, integration with external systems (WMS, ERP), and any bespoke features introduced during the deployment process are specific to each installation. These custom features may not align with standard industry certifications.
* **Site-Specific Variability**: Each deployment may vary based on site-specific conditions such as warehouse size, throughput demands, environmental factors, and local safety regulations.

Due to this bespoke nature, the overall system installation cannot be certified as a whole. However, the individual components (hardware and software) used in the platform comply with industry standards, and certifications can be provided for each element of the system upon request.
