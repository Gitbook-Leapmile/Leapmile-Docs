* **Material**: Racks are made of aluminium extrusion profiles, which is a material with a high strength-to-weight ratio, capable of supporting heavy loads and flexible deployment characteristics.
* **Height & Depth**: Customizable rack dimensions accommodate the required bin sizes and warehouse layout. Typical rack heights are \~3.3m.
* **Bin Slots**: Bins are designed for easy handling by shuttles. The system is able to handle bins with standard dimensions (e.g., 440mm x 640mm).
* **Weight Capacity**: Racks support a minimum weight of up to 20 kg per bin.
* **Rack Width**: Configurable for both single and double-deep racks to maximize space utilization.

### Shuttle System

* **Shuttle Types**:
  * Single Deep Shuttles: Used to retrieve and place bins in single deep storage slots.
  * Double Deep Shuttles: Specialized shuttles for retrieving bins from double deep storage locations. These support vertical movement (for bin stack retrieval) and horizontal travel across aisles.
* **Shuttle Motion**:
  * **Horizontal Movement**: Shuttles operate on high-precision tracks with smooth motion to minimize wear and friction. Tracks support speeds of up to 2 m/s.
  * **Vertical Movement**: Shuttles moving between double-deep racks have lifting and extension mechanisms to reach both front and rear bins, capable of vertical movements of up to \~3.3m.
  * **Drive Type**: Shuttles are equipped with electric drives (e.g., AC motors or DC motors (in the future may incorporate regenerative braking capabilities)) for high efficiency.
  * **Speed**: Shuttles operate at speeds of up to 1m/sec horizontally and 1m/sec vertically.
  * **Battery Power**: Shuttles are powered by a bus bar system with practically unlimited operating time.
  * **Communication**: Shuttles will communicate with the central control system via Wi-Fi or Ethernet for real-time status updates, task assignments, and error handling.

### Stations

#### Put Away Station

* **Functionality**: Operators or automated systems (e.g., conveyors) will deliver bins to the put-away station. The system will then assign an optimal storage location based on real-time data.
* **Interface with Shuttles**: The put-away station will interface with the shuttle system to place bins in either single or double-deep racks.
* **Put Away Optimization**: The system automatically chooses the most efficient rack location for put away, considering factors like available space and item popularity (frequent items placed in easily accessible locations).
* **Load Capacity**: Each station supports up to 25 kg of overall bin load (bin + contents).
* **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**: Operators will be provided with a touchscreen interface to monitor put-away activities and, if needed, override the system.

### Pick Station

* **Functionality**: A pick station retrieves bins from the racks (via shuttles), and the operator picks items from the bins. It can also interface with automated picking systems (e.g., robotic arms).
* **Automatic Retrieval**: Shuttles automatically deliver bins to the pick station as part of the order fulfilment process.
* **Batch Picking**: Supports both single order picking and batch picking (retrieving multiple bins for multiple orders at once).
* **Integration with Pickers**: The pick station can interface with automated picking systems such as robotic arms or goods-to-person systems.
* **Load Capacity**: Pick stations support bins of various weights, with a maximum load of 25 kg/bin.

### 2.3.3 Transfer Station

* **Functionality**: The transfer station facilitates the movement of bins between different automation elements like conveyors, pickers, and the shuttle system.
* **Conveyor Integration**: The transfer station integrates seamlessly with conveyors to move bins in and out of the platform.
* **AGV Integration**: Bins can be transferred to and from the platform to external AGVs for further transport to other areas of the warehouse.
* **Capacity**: Each transfer station should handle a load of up to 25 kg/bin at a time.

### Conveyor System

#### Conveyor Types

* **Roller Conveyors**: Standard conveyors for moving bins between stations and transfer points.
* **Belt Conveyors**: Used for fragile or small items that require a gentle transport method.
* **Chain Conveyors**: For heavy-duty applications, used in areas where bins are too heavy for rollers.
* **Sortation Conveyors**: Automatic sorting of bins to the appropriate stations or destinations based on order requirements.

#### Conveyor Control

* **Speed Control**: Conveyors should have variable speed controls to match the flow rate of bins.
* **Integrated Sensors**: Conveyor systems will use barcode scanners, RFID readers, or vision systems to identify bins and track their locations throughout the system.
* **Load Capacity**: Conveyor systems should be able to carry bins with a load capacity of up to 25 kg/bin.

### Control System

#### Central Control System

* **Architecture**: The control system will have a distributed architecture consisting of a central server and local controllers for each system component (shuttles, racks, stations, AGVs, etc.).
* **Real-Time Data Processing**: The system must handle real-time data processing and decision-making to ensure smooth operations, including task assignment and error detection.
* **Task Scheduling**: The central system will schedule tasks (e.g., shuttle movements, AGV routing, put-away, and picking) based on priority, order requirements, and system performance.
* **Data Storage**: The system will use a SQL-based or NoSQL database to store bin locations, inventory data, and historical performance metrics.

#### Communication Network

* **Communication Protocols**: The system will use Ethernet/IP, Modbus TCP, and Wi-Fi for communication between system components.
* **Real-Time Communication**: Low-latency communication is required for real-time operations, ensuring timely shuttle movements, AGV coordination, and order fulfilment.

#### User Interface (HMI)

* **Operator Control Panel**: Touchscreen panels at various stations and control centers to monitor system status, execute manual interventions, and generate reports.
* **Alarm/Notification System:** Alerts will be sent to operators for system faults, jams, and error states through both visual (HMI) and audible notifications.
* **Mobile Integration**: Operators and warehouse managers can access system information remotely via mobile apps or web dashboards.

### Safety and Security

#### Safety Features

* **Emergency Stop**: Emergency stop buttons should be located throughout the warehouse for quick shutdown of all automated equipment.
* **Collision Avoidance**: The shuttle system and conveyors are equipped with sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, or infrared) to avoid collisions with other machines and human operators.
* **Safety Barriers**: Physical barriers are placed around high-traffic automated areas to ensure the safety of workers.

#### Security Features

* **Access Control**: Access to the control system and physical system components (e.g., maintenance panels, sensitive areas) is restricted with role-based authentication (e.g., OTP, RFID badges, biometric scans).
* **Data Encryption**: All system communication (including shuttles and stations) is encrypted using TLS or VPNs to protect data from external threats.
* **Audit Logs**: The system maintains an audit trail of actions performed by users and system events for security and traceability purposes.

### Maintenance and Support
