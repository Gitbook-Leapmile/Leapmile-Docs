# Troubleshooting and System Optimization

### Common Issues:

* **Shuttle Errors**: Investigating and resolving common shuttle faults, including misalignment, communication failures, or software errors.
* **System Jams**: Identifying causes and resolving issues in console or conveyor systems.
* **Picking Failures**: Diagnosing user errors, mechanical or software-related problems when picking items.

### System Optimization Techniques:

* Adjusting shuttle speeds and paths to minimize cycle time.
* Reconfiguring pick paths to reduce congestion in high-traffic zones.
* Fine-tuning WMS-Nano synchronization to prevent errors in order picking.

### Hands-On Troubleshooting:

* Supervisors and engineers working through real-time troubleshooting exercises in a controlled environment (simulator or test system).
