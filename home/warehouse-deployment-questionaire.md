# Warehouse Deployment Questionaire

### Warehouse Operations and Workflow

What is the current workflow for receiving, storing, picking, and shipping goods? \
What are the peak and average daily volumes for inbound and outbound operations?\
Are there specific SKUs or products that require special handling (e.g., hazardous materials, refrigerated items)? \
What is the current picking accuracy rate, and what are the target improvements?

### Inventory Characteristics

What is the total number of SKUs stored in the warehouse?\
What are the dimensions and weight ranges of the items to be stored (e.g., smallest, largest, heaviest)? \
What are the sizes, counts, and different characteristics of the bins used in the warehouse? \
What is the turnover rate for inventory (e.g., fast-moving vs. slow-moving items)? \
Are there seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels or product mix?

### Storage Requirements

What is the total storage capacity required (in pallets, bins, or units)? \
What is the current storage density, and what are the target improvements? \
Are there specific requirements for storage configurations (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, batch picking)? \
Are there any existing storage systems (e.g., racks, shelving) that need to be integrated or replaced? What is the distribution of items across size categories. What% & count of items fit in plastic bins?

### Space and Layout

What are the dimensions of the warehouse (length, width, height, clearances)? \
What is the rack/bin/item numbering system? Are there QR codes or barcodes used? \
Are there any obstructions (e.g., columns, doors, HVAC systems) that could impact ASRS installation?What is the available floor space for ASRS equipment and aisles? \
Are there plans for future expansion or reconfiguration of the warehouse?

### Throughput and Performance

What is the required throughput for the system (e.g., units per hour, orders per day)? \
What are the target cycle times for storage and retrieval operations? \
Are there specific performance metrics (e.g., uptime, response time) that need to be met?

### Integration with Existing Systems

What Warehouse Management System (WMS) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is currently in use? \
How will the ASRS integrate with existing conveyor systems, sorters, or other automation? \
Are there any barcode scanning, RFID, or other tracking systems in place? \
Is there a pick list, and how is post-picking reconciliation completed?

### Power and Infrastructure

What is the power capacity available for the ASRS system? \
Is there a UPS connection based on a genset? Is the power line conditioned? \
Is there a high-speed internet connection available with all ports open? \
Can it be provisioned as an Ethernet port, and is a static public IP address available? \
Are there specific requirements for electrical, network, or data connectivity? \
Are there any environmental considerations (e.g., temperature, humidity, dust)?

### Safety and Compliance

What safety regulations or standards must the ASRS comply with (e.g., OSHA, fire codes)? \
Are there specific requirements for worker access or interaction with the system? \
Are there any historical safety incidents or concerns in the warehouse?

### Budget and ROI Expectations

What is the budget for the ASRS project, including installation, maintenance, and training? \
What are the expected ROI and payback period for the system? \
Are there any constraints on capital expenditure or operational costs?

### Maintenance and Support

What is the expected maintenance schedule for the ASRS system? \
Are there in-house technicians available for maintenance, or will it require external support? \
What is the expected lifespan of the system, and are there plans for future upgrades?

### Future-Proofing and Scalability

Are there plans for future growth or changes in product mix that the ASRS should accommodate? \
How flexible does the system need to be to adapt to changing business needs? \
Are there any emerging technologies (e.g., AI, machine learning) that should be considered for integration?

### Training and Change Management

What training will be required for staff to operate and maintain the ASRS?\
How will the transition to the new system be managed to minimize disruption? \
Are there any concerns or resistance from staff regarding automation?
